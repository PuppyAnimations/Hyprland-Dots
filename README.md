## My Hyprland install Scripts
- You can install Hyprland using Scripts below:
- [Arch-Linux](https://github.com/PuppyAnimations/Arch-Hyprland)
- Refer to install scripts what packages needed to install... but atleast, Hyprland packages are needed.

### üëÄ Screenshots
- All screenshots are collected [here](https://github.com/PuppyAnimations/Hyprland-Dots-Showcase).

#### üì¶ Whats new?
- To easily track changes, I will be updating the changelogs. [CHANGELOGS](https://github.com/PuppyAnimations/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Changelogs)  Screenshots will be included if worth it!

### üí• Copying / Installation / Update instructions üí•
- [`MORE INFO HERE`](https://github.com/PuppyAnimations/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Install_&_Update) 
> [!Note] 
> The auto copy script will create backups of intended folders to be copied. However, still a good idea to manually backup just incase script failed to backup!
- ~/.config (btop cava hypr kitty rofi swappy swaync waybar wlogout) - These are folders to be copied.
- ~/Pictures/wallpapers - Will be backed up
- Clone this repo by using git. Change directory, make executable and run the script:
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/PuppyAnimations/Hyprland-Dots.git
cd Hyprland-Dots
```
- to copy/install from upstream (possible bugs):
```bash
chmod +x copy.sh
./copy.sh
```
- to copy/install from releases (more "stable"):
```bash
chmod +x release.sh
./release.sh
```

- UPGRADE.sh (Experimental):
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should atleast v1.0.0 in your hyprland dots (ls ~/.config/hypr) to check version
> You need rsync for it to work

> [!CAUTION]
> You should have already up and running Hyprland before using this function
```bash
chmod +x upgrade.sh
./upgrade.sh
```

#### üõéÔ∏è A small note on wallpapers
- by default, only few wallpapers will be copied (1 each dark and light plus 2 more). You will be offered to download more wallpapers. You can preview/check the additional wallpapers on [THIS](https://github.com/PuppyAnimations/Wallpaper-Bank/tree/main/wallpapers) Link

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è A MUST! after copying / Installing these dots

+ By default I have not set a wallpaper. Press SUPER W and set a wallpaper. This is also to initiate pywal for waybar, kitty (tty) and rofi themes. If you use the copy.sh script, you wont need to do this.
+ Nvidia Owners. Make sure to edit your `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ENVariables.conf` (recommended). Below env's will be activated if automatic copy is used
> WLR_NO_CURSORS,1 , LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME,nvidia ,  __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME,nvidia 
- NVIDIA users / owners, after installation, check [THIS](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Notes_to_remember#--for-nvidia-gpu-users).
+ If you have already set your own keybinds, monitors, etc.... Just copy over from backup created before log-out or reboot. (recommended)
